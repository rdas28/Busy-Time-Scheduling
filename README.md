Busy Time Scheduling Program
This Python script implements a scheduling algorithm to solve a minimum-cost scheduling problem. The program reads job data from an input file, calculates the optimal schedule using dynamic programming, and writes the solution to an output file.

Features
Dynamic Programming Approach: Calculates the minimum-cost schedule for a set of jobs within specified time intervals.
Input and Output Handling: Reads jobs and constraints from an input file and saves the computed schedule in an output file.
Customizable Jobs: Each job has a release time, deadline, and processing time, allowing flexibility in scheduling.
