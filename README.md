Busy Time Scheduling Program
This Python script implements a scheduling algorithm to solve a minimum-cost scheduling problem. The program reads job data from an input file, calculates the optimal schedule using dynamic programming, and writes the solution to an output file.

Features
Dynamic Programming Approach: Calculates the minimum-cost schedule for a set of jobs within specified time intervals.
Input and Output Handling: Reads jobs and constraints from an input file and saves the computed schedule in an output file.
Customizable Jobs: Each job has a release time, deadline, and processing time, allowing flexibility in scheduling.
How It Works
Input Format:
The input file should contain:

The first line with an integer n (the number of jobs).
The following n lines, each containing three integers r, d, and p:
r: The release time of the job.
d: The deadline by which the job must be completed.
p: The processing time of the job.
Example input (instance01.txt):

0 10 3

4 8 1
Output Format:
The output file will contain n lines, each with the start time for the corresponding job in the input file.

Algorithm:

Generate Interesting Times: Creates a sorted set of all possible time intervals from job release times and deadlines.
Dynamic Programming: Uses a 2D DP table to compute the minimum cost for scheduling jobs within each time interval.
Backtracking: Constructs the optimal schedule by backtracking through the DP table.
Usage
Save the script as scheduler.py.
Run the script from the command line with the input and output file names as arguments:
php

python scheduler.py <input_file> <output_file>

Requirements
Python 3.x
Code Structure
read_input(file_name): Reads job data from the input file.
write_output(file_name, schedule): Writes the schedule to the output file.
busy_time_scheduling(n, jobs): The main algorithm to compute the schedule.
Main Block: Handles command-line arguments for file input and output.

Notes
Ensure that the input file format is correct to avoid parsing errors.
This script assumes that all job constraints are feasible.
